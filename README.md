# Golem: First of Stone Mod (Fabric)

**A simple mod to add the First of Stone from Minecraft Legends into Minecraft Java Edition.**

Craft a *Carved Stone Head* by surrounding a Lodestone with Stone blocks, then find a broken down First of Stone structure out in the world and reawaken it! It's expensive because it has like 1000 HP and strong AoE attacks lol.

Requires Fabric Modloader, Fabric API, and GeckoLib. Supports Minecraft Java Edition 1.20.1 only.
