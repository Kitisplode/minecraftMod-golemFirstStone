# Minecraft Mod - Golem Dandori Version 0.0.8 (Fabric)

---

Golem Dandori
---
BIG NOTE: If you're having world generation issues, try switching to the 0.0.7 no dandori version. This removes the structures that may be causing those crashes on some installs. If you've created a world using a previous version, it seems that the game will simply erase these structures (as they are below the bedrock).
Future versions will not have these structures (at least not implemented this way) so should hopefully not continue to run into this issue...

A mod to add the Golem Firsts from other Minecraft content into Minecraft Java Edition.

Contains all the Golems that originate from Minecraft Legends, including the Cobblestone Golem, the Plank Golem, the Mossy Golem, and the Grindstone Golem, as well as the Firsts, including the First of Stone, the First of Oak, the First of Brick, and the first of Diorite.

Also includes the Copper Golem and Tuff Golem from the past two mob votes.

---

Small Golems:

Cobblestone Golems can be created by stacking a couple blocks of cobblestone and putting a carved pumpkin on top.
These little guys will simply run up to a target and then punch them.

Plank Golems can be made with a stack of two oak planks blocks with a pumpkin put on top.
These golems will shoot the arrows from its head at far away enemies.

By stacking a mossy cobblestone, a moss block, and a carved pumpkin, a Mossy Golem can be constructed.
These flower-wearing golems will seek out allies that are less than full health and give them short bursts of Regeneration.

The Grindstone Golem requires putting a carved pumpkin atop a grindstone.
These golems will approach enemies, then charge through them, dealing damage and knockback to any enemy they hit with the dash.
You can also ride on them by right clicking on them!

The Copper Golem can be built with a couple copper blocks or cut copper blocks and a carved pumpkin on top.
They function similar to how they were introduced in the Mob Vote 2021, rushing to press buttons and rusting over time.

The Tuff Golem is also built with a carved pumpkin placed on top of a pair of tuff blocks.
Like in their trailer from Mob Vote 2022, these golems like to pick up and proudly display items. They also have a tendency to fall asleep.

The Firsts:

Each First has 500 HP and special attacks. (Previously 1000 but that seemed a little much lol)

They take a bit of effort to create as the player will need to track down their heads then place them in their matching bodies scattered throughout the world.



Craft a Chiseled Stone Head by surrounding a Lodestone with Stone blocks, then find a broken down First of Stone structure out in the world and reawaken it!

It attacks with an AoE melee attack that deals massive damage and knocks back many enemies at once.



Craft a Carved Oak Head with a Lodestone and Oak Wood blocks, and place it in a First of Oak structure in the world.

When it spots an enemy from far away, it can shoot arrows from a huge range that deal AoE damage around the impact point.



Craft a Sculpted Emerald Head with a Lodestone and Emerald blocks, then place it in a First of Brick structure in the world.

Instead of attacking, the First of Brick will approach allies that are under attack and cast an AoE shield spell that gives all nearby allies a short burst of Absorption.



Craft a Sculpted Gold Head with a Lodestone and Gold blocks, then place it in a First of Diorite structure in the world.

The First of Diorite also does not attack directly, instead summoning a small group of Diorite Pawns to attack its targets instead.

I didn't really like the idea of it spawning the small golems since i felt players should make those themselves, so they have their own special Diorite Pawns based on some familiar faces...


You can alternatively obtain the First Heads from associated villagers in some villages instead of crafting them (this might become the only way at some point idk)

Features currently planned for future updates:
+ Add the flame inside of First of Diorite's head lol
+ Add some interactions between the Firsts and the villagers, similar to the Iron Golem.
+ Maybe some of the other golems from other Minecraft spinoffs?
+ Some refinement in how to spawn golems to make it more... interesting?
+ Additional behaviors for Mob Vote golems to make them... useful... lol
+ More Dandori???


Compatibility notes:
+ There are mixins for Snow Golems, Iron Golems, and Carved Pumpkin Blocks, so this mod may be incompatible with other mods that affect those, too.
+ There are some player mixins, but i don't think they'd cause issues probably?
+ The Overworld dimension is modified to have more space beneath the void. I don't know if this will definitely break things, but it might?
