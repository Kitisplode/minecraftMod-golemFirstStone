# Minecraft Mod - Golem Dandori: Firsts of Legend Version 0.0.5 (Fabric)

---

**A simple mod to add the Golem Firsts from Minecraft Legends into Minecraft Java Edition.**

Currently contains all the Firsts, including the First of Stone, the First of Oak, the First of Brick, and the first of Diorite.

---

Craft a *Chiseled Stone Head* by surrounding a Lodestone with Stone blocks, then find a broken down First of Stone structure out in the world and reawaken it!

Craft a *Carved Oak Head* with a Lodestone and Oak Wood blocks, and place it in a First of Oak structure in the world.

Craft a *Sculpted Emerald Head* with a Lodestone and Emerald blocks, then place it in a First of Brick structure in the world.

Craft a *Sculpted Gold Head* with a Lodestone and Gold blocks, then place it in a First of Diorite structure in the world.

You can alternatively obtain the First Heads from associated villagers in some villages.

---

Each First has 1000 HP and special attacks.

First of Stone has an AoE melee attack that deals massive damage and knocks back many enemies at once.

First of Oak shoots arrows with a huge range that deal AoE damage around the impact point.

First of Brick, instead of attacking, will approach allies that are under attack and cast an AoE shield spell that gives all nearby allies a short burst of absorption.

First of Diorite also does not attack directly, instead summoning a small group of Diorite Pawns to attack its targets instead.

---

Features currently planned for future updates:
+ Add the flame inside of First of Diorite's head lol
+ Add some interactions between the Firsts and the villagers, similar to the Iron Golem.
+ Maybe some of the other golems from other Minecraft spinoffs?
+ Dandori???

Compatibility notes:
+ There are mixins for Snow Golems, Iron Golems, and Carved Pumpkin Blocks, so this mod may be incompatible with other mods that affect those, too.

**Requires Fabric Modloader, Fabric API, and GeckoLib. Supports Minecraft Java Edition 1.20.1 only.**
