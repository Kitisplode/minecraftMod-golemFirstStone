# Minecraft Mod - Golem: Firsts of Legend (Fabric)

---

**A simple mod to add the Golem Firsts from Minecraft Legends into Minecraft Java Edition.**

Currently includes the First of Stone and the First of Oak.

Craft a *Carved Stone Head* by surrounding a Lodestone with Stone blocks, then find a broken down First of Stone structure out in the world and reawaken it!

Same with a *Carved Oak Head*, craft it by surrounding a Lodestone with Oak Wood blocks to use on a First of Oak structure in the world.

They're expensive because they have like 1000 HP and strong AoE attacks lol.

**Requires Fabric Modloader, Fabric API, and GeckoLib. Supports Minecraft Java Edition 1.20.1 only.**
