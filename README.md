# Golem: First of Stone Mod (Forge)

**A simple mod to add the First of Stone from Minecraft Legends into Minecraft Java Edition.**

Craft a *Carved Stone Head* by surrounding a Lodestone with Stone blocks.
It's expensive because it has like 1000 HP and has strong AoE attacks lol.

Requires Forge Modloader and GeckoLib.
Supports Minecraft Java Edition 1.20.1 only.
